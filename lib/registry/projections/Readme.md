#### Projection modules
As supplied, OL3 supports the global EPSG:4326 (GPS-style latitude and longitude coordinates in degrees of angle) and EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator, as used by Google, OSM, Bing et al), and the conversion of coordinates between these two. Other projections are supported using [Proj4js](http://proj4js.org/). Each module in the projections registry defines the projection definition and exports the projection code so it can be imported by the appropriate source. OL's global-based implementation of Proj4js is not used. Instead each module calls `addProjection()` in `common.js` which imports `ext/proj4.js`, adds the projection definition to it, and then adds the Proj4js transform functions to `ol.proj`.

A custom ES-module build of Proj4js is used, which includes only those projection types used. Clearly, if a new projection using a different projection type is added, this will also have to be included in the Proj4js build.
