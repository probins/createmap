#### Projection modules
As supplied, OL3 supports the global EPSG:4326 (GPS-style latitude and longitude coordinates in degrees of angle) and EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator, as used by Google, OSM, Bing et al), and the conversion of coordinates between these two. Other projections are supported using [Proj4js](http://proj4js.org/). Each module in the projections registry imports the projection definition and exports the projection code so it can be imported by the appropriate source. OL's global-based implementation of Proj4js is not used. Instead, a custom ES-module build of Proj4js, currently on the Github `probins/myproj` repository (`dist/esbare/`), is used, where projection types are only imported when used. This reduces the amount of code which has to be loaded for any given map. Each module calls `addProjection()` in `common.js` which imports `proj4.js` from the Github repository, adds the projection definition to it, and then adds the Proj4js transform functions to `ol.proj`.
